# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
Not very confident, I need more practice.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
Some productive, as the day went on, more unproductive.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Everything regarding javascript syntax and methods. My schedule is open between mod0 and mod1, so I will make the time to further practice and take more notes until the workflow is more smooth.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I have many questions. Will mod1 move through topics just as fast, or is there a more in depth dive into each new concept? As far as technical questions, I have many, but plan to answer them with personal research, practice. If I can't find a solution, I'll reach out to my peers.
